# Practice with Browserify

## Description
At the most basic level, Browserify is used to create modular JavaScript applications for the browser. It uses the require() syntax from the Node.js tools to pull in dependencies that are written in other modules.

All of the modules are then weaved, or stiched, together to produce one, larger JavaScript file that places all of your modules in the right order for use in your application.

Let's look at a very basic example of building a calculator application where each operation is in its own module.

## How to run
In your terminal run:
```
http-server -p 9999
```
then navigate to [here](http://localhost:9999) in your browser.
